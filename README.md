### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**hebrotem/hebrotem** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student at Purdue University in Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE).  
- ðŸ”­ My research focuses on agricultural robotics, human-robot collaboration, and autonomous navigation in unstructured environments.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m exploring multimodal perception for real-time decision-making in robotic systems.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on reinforcement learning (RL) for robotic navigation and precision agriculture.  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking insights into visual and LiDAR odometry for robust robot localization.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about robotics, AI for agriculture, and human-AI interaction.  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...  
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Te-mee-tor-pe  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love exploring how robots and humans can work together seamlessly.
